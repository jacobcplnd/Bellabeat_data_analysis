# Bellabeat_data_analysis
This is my Google Data Analytics Capstone project
In this project, I walk through the data analysis process to gain insight on how to make Bellabeat a larger player in the global
smart device market.
I used data Fitbit user data provided by Kaggle to acheive this goal.
This is the link to that data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit
After exporting the file into RStudio, I began the cleaning and analysis process.
I then created several bar graphs and provided my recommendations to help meet the business task needs.
